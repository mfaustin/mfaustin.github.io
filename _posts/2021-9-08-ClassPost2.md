## R and Other Software

-   R compared to other software I’ve used?

Before this class, my R experience was limited to R simulation work in
the first semester statistical theory class. I’ve had much more
experience with SAS at the level where I was able to earn SAS
certifications. I’ve also worked with Perl, PHP, Python, JMP,
PowerShell, and other software over the years. My experience with R so
far is that R has the flexibility of Perl and Python but R also has
common ways to use objects for standard analysis. One of the biggest
advantages of R compared to SAS is with R a user can work with more
current methods via R packages whereas with SAS a user has to wait for
SAS to add a feature assuming the feature will ever be added to SAS.
Another big R advantage is the flexibility of the object oriented
approach. When using SAS, sometimes simple logic had to be implemented
in complex macros because SAS was inflexible. In contrast, with R my
experience so far has been that simple logic has had simple
implementation.

-   What do you like about R functionality?

R’s biggest strength so far has been the integration of R Markdown with
R Studio allowing for straightforward production of high quality output
in multiple formats. In that sense, R seems to have a more complete
ecosystem available for getting day to day work accomplished in an
efficient manner than other languages.

-   What do you miss about another language?

The biggest part I miss about SAS compared to R is that most of SAS can
only be coded a certain way or just a few ways whereas with R there are
so many ways to code that it can be hard to keep up with all the nuances
like base R and other similar packages. I’ve worked with a lot of SAS
programs over the years and would estimate fewer than 5% were hard for
me to follow based on the SAS code. With R code I’ve found myself
needing to look things up more often than I did with SAS code.

-   Do you consider R a hard language to learn?

R has been the type of language that is easy to get started but much
more challenging to master. My prior experience with Perl and Python has
helped facilitate R learning. Given that SAS itself invests a lot in
training resources, it was easier for me to use those resources and
focus on a certain learning path that eventually led to SAS
certification. With R the volume of available information can make it
harder to focus. One of the main benefits of this class so far has been
having a coherent learning path that builds on itself to help develop
positive R foundation experiences.
